# SMART-ATS


Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Set up a virtual environment: This helps manage dependencies.

bash
python -m venv jobfitenv
source jobfitenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `jobfitenv\Scripts\activate`
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install necessary libraries using pip:

bash
pip install streamlit pandas openai
Step 3: Integrate the Large Language Model (LLM)
You mentioned using GEMINI, an LLM. You can replace this with any other LLM if needed. For this example, I'll demonstrate with OpenAI's GPT.

python
import openai

# Set up the OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def analyze_resume(resume_text, job_description):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="davinci-codex",
        prompt=f"Analyze the following resume and job description: {resume_text}\n{job_description}",
        max_tokens=500
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
Step 4: Build the Streamlit Application
Create a Python script for the Streamlit app (e.g., app.py):

python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Job Fit Analyzer")

resume_text = st.text_area("Paste your resume here:")
job_description = st.text_area("Paste the job description here:")

if st.button("Analyze"):
    with st.spinner("Analyzing..."):
        result = analyze_resume(resume_text, job_description)
        st.success("Analysis Complete!")
        st.write(result)
Step 5: Run the Streamlit Application
Run the application locally:

bash
streamlit run app.py
Step 6: Deploy the Application
To deploy the application, you can use various platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Sharing. Here's an example of how to deploy it to Streamlit Sharing:

Push your repository to GitHub.

Go to Streamlit Sharing, connect your GitHub account, and deploy your repository.

Example Repository
Here's a link to a sample repository that you can fork and modify: Job Fit Analyzer on GitHub.
